___
> [!key] Key
> - Force executed by string, rope, cable, etc. 
> - Assume all strings = massless
> - If string were to break, assume it would break in the middle
> - Tension follows [[Newtons 3rd Law]] (Force from top on bottom is equal and opposite)
> - Tension is the same throughout the string

#### Example
___
Imagine a game of tug of war where both sides are pulling w/ 500N of force. What is the tension in the rope?
	a) 0N
	b) 500N
	c) 1000N
	d) Other

### Pulley Machines
___
- Pulleys used to change direction while keeping other factors like friction
- Assume pulleys are frictionless

### Atwood Machines
---
- Each Mass hanging from either side of the pulley

### Pulley Machine Tips
---
> [!tip] Tip
> - Be careful about directions and adjust as needed
> - Both masses must have same acceleration but can have different net forces
> - Combine the masses together for some problems
