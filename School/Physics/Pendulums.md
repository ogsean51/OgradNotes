___
- Pendulum = a mass that swings back and forth from a fixed point
	- Mass
	- Length
	- Angle
- Only length affects period
- Many of the same [[Formula Sheet#Circular Motion|formulas]] as [[Circular Motion]]
L = Length
g = Gravity (9.81 by default, but sometimes it's a given)
$$
\begin{align}
T = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{L}{g} }
\end{align}
$$
- Mass has no effect (Remember Kinematics)
- Angles are more complicated
	- Small angle approximation
	- Usually much less than 1 rad (57<sup>o</sup>)
	- Often less than 0.1 rad (6<sup>o</sup>)

### Practice
___
1. What is the frequency of a pendulum of length 6.89 mm?
$$
\begin{align}
T = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{6.89}{9.8} } \\
T = 5.27 \\
f = \frac{1}{5.268} \\
f = 0.1898

\end{align}
$$
2. A pendulum on earth oscillates 5 times in 7.84 seconds. What would be the period of this pendulum on Mars? (g = 3.72 m/s2)

cycles / revs = 5 times
sec = 7.84
$$
\begin{align}
T = \frac{7.84}{5} \\
T = 1.568
\end{align}
$$
