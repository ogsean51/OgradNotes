### Electric Potential Difference
___
- Measured in Volts
- Volts = Joules/Coulomb
![[JP - CircuitsGainVDrop.png|400]]
### Electric current 
___
- Amount of charge moving through a point over a period of time
- Amperes = Coulombs / Second
- Direction of current doesn't matter
### Resistance
___
- all objects have some resistance
- Conductors = Low Resistance
- Insulators = High Resistance
- Ohmic = Constant resistance
- Non-Ohmic = Variable resistance
### Efficiency
___
- Some percentage wasted energy is produced
- Some things more efficient with energy than others
$$
\begin{align}
Efficiency = \frac{Out}{In} \cdot 100
\end{align}
$$

### Resistors
___
- Can be in series or in parallel
- Series
	- one after another in path of wire
	- The more resistors = more total resistance
- Parallel = resistors on separate branches, wire splits at junctions
	- The more resistors = less total resistance

#### Kirchoffs Laws
- Voltage
	- All voltage gained at battery must be dropped before return to battery
	- Voltage in series
		- One path for charges to take
		- Total voltage drop is split between resistors
		- Higher resistance = more voltage drop
- Current
	- when wire splits at junction, current also splits
	- Current in Series
		-
