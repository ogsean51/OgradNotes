> [!key] An Object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force

- 2 Conditions
	1. Object can be moving but at a constant speed
	2. Object is at rest
- Constraint: forces must be balanced, if all forces are balanced then the sum is zero
#### Example
---
Car moving with coffee on top, if the car takes a right turn the cup will continue moving in the same direction and its direction and velocity can only be changed through the effects of forces like air resistance, friction, gravity, etc.
