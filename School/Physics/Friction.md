___
> [!key] The opposing force from sliding objects

- Dependent on 3 factors
	1. The material of the sliding object
	2. The material of the surface
	3. The amount of force the surface applies

> [!Definition] Coefficient of Friction
> - A number that relates the two surfaces
> - Unitless
> - Can be found by angling surface until object starts sliding
> $\mu = \tan \Theta$
> $\Theta$ = measure of an angle

- Coefficient is the component related to the materials
- The Normal force is how much the surface pushes up on the object
[[Formula Sheet#Forces|Formulas]]
$$
\begin{align}
Ff = \mu \cdot N
\end{align}
$$

#### Types of Friction
---
Imagine you are pushing a very heavy couch. It does not move with just any amount of force, when it starts moving it requires less force to keep going than it did to begin moving.

- The coefficient of static (not moving) friction will always be greater than that of kinetic (moving) friction
