___
Force of Gravity has two forces, one parallel and one perpendicular to surface

## Practice: Incline, No Friction
8.5kg box sitting on frictionless surface angled at 32<sup>o</sup> from horizontal. What is the acceleration of the box?

$$
\begin{align}
Fg = m \cdot g \\
Fg = (8.5)(9.8) \\
Fg = 83.3N \\
 \\
FN = Fg \perp \\
Fg\parallel = \Sigma F \\
\sin(\theta) = \frac{o}{h} \\
\sin(32)=\frac{Fg\parallel}{83.3} \\
Fg\parallel = 44.14N \\
 \\
\Sigma F = m\cdot a \\
44.14=8.5\cdot a \\
a=5.2
\end{align}
$$
## Practice: Incline, Equilibrium
An 8.5kg box is sitting on a surface that is angled at 32<sup>o</sup> from the horizontal. What is the maximum coefficient of static friction between the box and the surface such that the box remains at rest?

$$
\begin{align}
Fg = 83.3N \\
Fg\parallel=44.14N \\
FN = Fg\perp \\
Ff = Fg\parallel \\
 \\
\cos(32)=\frac{Fg\perp}{83.3} \\
Fg\perp = 70.64N \\
Ff = \mu \cdot FN \\
44.14=\mu \cdot 70.64 \\
\mu = 0.62
\end{align}
$$
## Practice: Incline, Accelerating
8.5kg box is sitting on a surface that is angled at 32<sup>o</sup> from the horizontal. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the surface is 0.23. What is the acceleration of the box?
![[JP - ForcesOnInclineEmbed2]]
$$
\begin{align}
a = ? \\
\mu = 0.23 \\
Ff = \mu \cdot FN \\
Fg = m\cdot a \\

\end{align}
