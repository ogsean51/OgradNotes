___
> [!key] Every action has an **equal and opposite** reaction

- Force is equal in magnitude
- Force is opposite in Direction
- Applies same force but due to differing masses, acceleration is different
#### Example A
	bat applies force on baseball
	baseball apples force to bat
	results: vibration, sound, recoil

#### Example B
Earth and apple, earth and apple apply same gravitational force to each other, but due to differing masses their effect is out of proportion

m<sub>apple</sub> = 0.1kg
m<sub>earth</sub> = 6.0 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg

##### Force applied to both objects
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Sigma F = m \cdot a\\
\Sigma F = (0.1)(-9.8)\\
\Sigma F = -0.98N
\end{aligned}


$$
##### Acceleration applied to Earth
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Sigma F = m \cdot a \\
0.98 = (6.0 \times 10^{24}) \cdot a\\
a = 1.63 \times 10^{-25}
\end{aligned}
$$

> [!note] In the real world, there are billions of tiny gravitational pulls on the earth in all different directions, causing them all to essentially cancel out
