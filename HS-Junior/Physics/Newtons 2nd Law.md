___
> [!key] The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the Net Force ($\Sigma$F) and inversely proportional to the mass

#### Practice
---
A 10kg box is being pulled across the table to the right by a tight rope with an applied force of 50N. Calculate the acceleration of the box if a 12N frictional force acts upon it.

> - Write equations of motion by adding and subtracting vectors of motion to find the Net Force
> 	Always  write larger force - smaller force
> - Solve for unknowns
