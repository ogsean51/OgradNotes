___
- Reactionary force created by pressing on surface
- Always perpendicular to surface, away
- You can measure normal force with scale
- if surface is horizontal and nothing is pushing/pulling vertically
   then Fn is equal to wieght
- otherwise depends on other forces and acceleration

### Practice
25kg block of stone sitting on a table, what is normal force if...

a) It just sits on the table?
$$
\begin{align}\\
Fg = m \cdot g \\
Fg = (25)(9.8) \\
Fg = 245N
\end{align}\\
$$

b) If you push down on the stone with 35N?
$$
\begin{align}
Fn = 245 + 35 \\
Fn = 280N
\end{align}
$$
c) If you tie a string around it and pull up with 55N?
$$
\begin{align}
Fn = 245 - 55 \\
Fn = 190N
\end{align}
$$

## Normal Force and Friction
---
> [!danger] Remember, **normal force** affects friction not the weight
- If conditions affect the normal force it will also affect friction

### Practice
You have two blocks of wood on a table made of the same wood. One block is 5kg and it's resting atop a 10kg block. The coefficient of the static friction of the wood is 0.42. what is the maximum force of static friction on each block?

$$
\begin{align}
Fg = m \cdot g \\
Fg = (5)(9.8) \\
Fg = 49N = Fn
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
Ff = \mu \cdot Fn\\
Ff = (0.42)(49)\\
Ff = 21N
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
Ff = \mu \cdot Fn\\
Ff = (0.42)(147)\\
Ff = 62N
\end{aligned}
$$
## Elevators
- When elevator is at rest/at a constant speed, there is no net force
	- Therefore the normal force equals the weight
- If the elevator accelerates (rest to motion, etc.), Then there is a net force
	- Therefore the normal force does not equal weight

### Practice
A 75kg person is standing in an elevator at the ground floor. They take it up to the first floor then back to the ground floor. The elevator can accelerate at 1.3 m/s2 in either direction. What is their normal force...

a) At rest at the ground floor
	equal to weight, 735N
b) **Accelerating** upward
	833N
c) At a constant speed moving up
	735N
d) **Decelerating** upward
	
e) At rest on the first floor
	735N
f) Accelerating downward

g) At a constant speed moving down
	735N
h) Decelerating downward
