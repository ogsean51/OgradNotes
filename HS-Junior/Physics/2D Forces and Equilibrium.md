## Newtons First Law in 2D
---
[[Newtons 1st Law]]

- If a force is at an angle, not completely vertical or horizontal, break it into components
- Then, if in equilibrium,
	- Balance the horizontal components with the other horizontal components ([[Vectors#Aspects of a Vector|x-component]])
	- Balance the vertical component with the other vertical components ([[Vectors#Aspects of a Vector|y-component]])
### Practice: Dog
---
A 30kg dog pulls on its leash, which keeps it from moving. The leash is tied to a wall, at a height so it creates a 75<sup>o</sup> angle from the vertical. If the tension on the leash is 154N...
	a) How hard is the dog pulling **forward**
	![[JP - 2DForcesPracticeEmbed1]]
$$
\begin{align}
\sin(\theta) = \frac{o}{h} \\ \\
\sin(75)=\frac{FTx}{154} \\ \\
FTx = 148.75N \\ \\
 \\
\cos(\theta) = \frac{a}{h} \\ \\
\cos(75) = \frac{FTy}{154} \\ \\
FTy = 39.86N \\ \\
 \\

\end{align}
$$
		***The dog is pulling forward 148.75N, or 150N***
	b) What is the apparent weight of the dog
$$
\begin{align}
Fg = m\cdot g \\ \\
Fg = (30)(9.8) \\ \\
Fg = 294N \\ \\
Fg = FN + FTy \\ \\
294 = FN+39.86 \\ \\
FN = 254.1N \\ \\
250N
\end{align}
$$
### Practice: Sign
---
A 12kg sign is hanging from two identical cables seperated by 110<sup>o</sup>. What is the tension in the cable?
![[JP - 2DForcesPracticeEmbed2]]
$$
\begin{align}
Fg = m\cdot g \\
Fg = (12)(9.8) \\
Fg = 117.6N \\
 \\
FTy = 117.6 / 2 \\
 \\
\cos(\theta) = \frac{a}{h} \\
\cos(55) = \frac{58.8}{FT} \\ 
FT = 100N
\end{align}
$$

## Practice: Sign 2
---
Sign supported by diagonal cable, angled at 42<sup>o</sup> from the horizontal, and a rigid horizontal bar. If the sign has a mass of 24kg, what is the tension in the cable?

![[JP - 2DForcesPracticeEmbed3]]

$$
\begin{align}
FTy = Fg \\
Fg = m\cdot g \\
Fg = (24)(9.8) \\
Fg = 235.2 \\
 \\
\sin(42) = \frac{235.2}{FT} \\
FT = \frac{235.2}{\sin(42)} \\
FT = 
\end{align}
$$

## What if NOT Balanced?
- Then theres an acceleration
- Sometimes no acceleration in one dimension, but an acceleration in another
	- e.g an object on the ground will have acceleration horizontally, but not vertically
- Otherwise, same sort of rules as equilibrium
	$\Sigma$F = m $\cdot$ a
	$\Sigma$F = Larger Force - Smaller Force

### Practice: Bicopter
---
A 1.2 kg bicopter uses two identical propellers angled 100<sup>o</sup> away from each other to acheive lift. At take-off the propeller have an identical amount of force to create an acceleration of 5.7 m/s<sup>2</sup>. How much force is created by each propeller?

#### Process: 
- Find F<sub>G</sub>
- Find $\Sigma$F
- $\Sigma$F = F<sub>A</sub> - F<sub>G</sub>
- F<sub>A</sub> = F<sub>G</sub> + $\Sigma$F
- Do like last problems, but make sure to divide total F<sub>A</sub> by 2 for 2 propellers
